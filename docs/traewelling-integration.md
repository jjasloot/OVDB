# Träwelling API Integration for OVDB

This document describes the Träwelling API integration that allows OVDB users to connect their Träwelling accounts and import their check-ins as RouteInstances.

## Overview

Träwelling is a check-in service for transit rides that allows users to log their journeys on trains, buses, metros, trams, and other public transport. This integration enables:

1. **OAuth2 Connection**: Users can connect their Träwelling account to OVDB using OAuth2 authorization
2. **Trip Import**: Import individual Träwelling check-ins as OVDB RouteInstances  
3. **Unimported Trips**: View Träwelling trips that haven't been imported to OVDB yet
4. **Backlog Processing**: Bulk import multiple trips from Träwelling history
5. **Metadata Sync**: Import trip metadata like descriptions, line names, and timing information from Träwelling
6. **Route Matching**: Automatically find or create OVDB Routes based on Träwelling trip data
7. **Time Enhancement**: Automatically add timing data to existing OVDB RouteInstances that lack it

## Database Changes

### User Model
Three new fields added to store OAuth2 tokens:
- `TrawellingAccessToken` (string): OAuth2 access token
- `TrawellingRefreshToken` (string): OAuth2 refresh token  
- `TrawellingTokenExpiresAt` (DateTime?): Token expiration timestamp

### RouteInstance Model
One new field added to link OVDB trips with Träwelling:
- `TrawellingStatusId` (int?): Links to the Träwelling status/check-in ID

## Configuration

Add to `appsettings.json` (see `appsettings.traewelling.example.json`):

```json
{
  "Traewelling": {
    "BaseUrl": "https://traewelling.de/api/v1",
    "AuthorizeUrl": "https://traewelling.de/oauth/authorize", 
    "TokenUrl": "https://traewelling.de/oauth/token",
    "ClientId": "your_client_id",
    "ClientSecret": "your_client_secret",
    "RedirectUri": "https://your-domain.com/api/traewelling/callback"
  }
}
```

## API Endpoints

### GET /api/traewelling/connect
Returns OAuth2 authorization URL for users to connect their Träwelling account.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "authorizationUrl": "https://traewelling.de/oauth/authorize?..."
}
```

### POST /api/traewelling/callback
Handles OAuth2 callback and exchanges authorization code for tokens.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "code": "auth_code_from_callback",
  "state": "security_state_parameter"
}
```

### GET /api/traewelling/status
Returns connection status and Träwelling user info if connected.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "connected": true,
  "user": {
    "id": 12345,
    "displayName": "User Name",
    "username": "username",
    "totalDistance": 50000,
    "totalDuration": 1440,
    "points": 250
  }
}
```

### GET /api/traewelling/unimported?page=1
Returns paginated list of Träwelling trips not yet imported to OVDB. Reads the local inbox;
`refresh=true` sweeps the statuses API first instead of waiting for the hourly staleness check.

The regular sweep reads at most 10 pages and stops at the first page holding nothing new,
which is correct only while check-ins arrive in order. One that was missed — a webhook that
never landed, a check-in made before the account was connected — sits behind pages of
already-imported ones and is out of its reach.

### POST /api/traewelling/import
Imports a specific Träwelling trip as an OVDB RouteInstance.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "statusId": 12345,
  "importMetadata": true,
  "importTags": true
}
```

### POST /api/traewelling/resync
Queues a walk of the whole statuses listing, past pages holding nothing new, adding everything
still unknown to the inbox. The history button next to refresh on the Träwelling page.

A whole history takes minutes to walk — longer than a request survives behind the reverse
proxy — so this returns **202 Accepted** immediately and `TraewellingResyncService` does the
walking. One walk per user: `queued: false` means one was already running.

```json
{ "queued": true }
```

Progress and outcome arrive over the hub (see Live updates), not in this response.
`resyncRunning` on `GET /status` says whether one is still going, so a page opened midway
shows it too.

### GET /api/traewelling/stats
Returns statistics about the user's Träwelling integration.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "connected": true,
  "importedTripsCount": 42,
  "tripsWithTimingCount": 38,
  "userTrawellingTripsCount": 25
}
```

### DELETE /api/traewelling/disconnect
Disconnects the Träwelling account by removing stored tokens.

## Live updates (`/traewellingHub`)

JWT-authenticated SignalR hub, delivering only the connected user's own events. Every payload
is a JSON string in the same shape as the REST responses, so the client parses rather than
maps it.

| Event | Sent when |
| --- | --- |
| `PendingTripUpserted` / `PendingTripRemoved` | A webhook event changed the unimported list |
| `ConflictUpserted` / `ConflictRemoved` | A webhook event changed the conflict list |
| `ResyncProgress` | Every five pages of a running resync: `{ pagesRead, added }` |
| `ResyncFinished` | A resync ended: `{ added, pagesRead, complete }` |

`complete: false` means the walk stopped on an error or the 1000-page safety limit, so older
check-ins may still be missing; a rerun starts at page 1 again.

## Authentication & Authorization

- All endpoints except `/callback` require JWT authentication
- OAuth2 tokens are automatically refreshed when needed
- Secure OAuth2 state validation with 10-minute expiry
- Tokens are stored securely in the database per user
- Users can only access their own Träwelling data

## Key Features

### 1. Trip Import with Route Matching
- Automatically finds existing OVDB Routes by origin/destination match
- Creates new Routes when none exist, with appropriate metadata
- Imports timing data (departure/arrival times) when available
- Calculates trip duration automatically
- Links RouteInstances to Träwelling status IDs to prevent duplicates

### 2. Metadata and Property Import
- Imports trip descriptions from Träwelling check-ins
- Adds transport category, line name, and distance/duration data
- Tags RouteInstances with source information for tracking
- Preserves Träwelling-specific metadata as RouteInstance properties

### 3. Backlog Processing for Existing Data
- Processes historical Träwelling data in batches
- Updates existing OVDB RouteInstances with timing data when available
- Smart matching algorithm finds best RouteInstance candidates
- Handles large backlogs without overwhelming the API
- Respects rate limits with automatic delays

### 4. Enhanced User Experience
- User-friendly statistics endpoint showing integration status
- Comprehensive error handling with helpful messages
- Automatic token refresh prevents user disruption
- Pagination support for large trip histories
- OAuth2 state validation prevents CSRF attacks

## Usage Flow

1. User clicks "Connect Träwelling" in OVDB
2. User is redirected to Träwelling OAuth authorization page
3. User authorizes OVDB and is redirected back with auth code
4. OVDB validates state and exchanges auth code for access/refresh tokens
5. User can now view unimported trips from Träwelling
6. User selects individual trips to import or processes entire backlog
7. Trips are created as RouteInstances with Träwelling metadata
8. Existing RouteInstances are enhanced with timing data where possible

- **Conflict resolution** - Better handling of duplicate/conflicting trips
- **Statistics dashboard** - Rich analytics about integration usage
- **Redis state storage** - Replace in-memory state cache for production scalability

## Error Handling

The service includes comprehensive error handling:
- OAuth2 flow errors (invalid codes, expired tokens, state validation)
- API rate limiting and timeout handling
- Network connectivity issues  
- Invalid or malformed API responses
- Token refresh failures
- Route matching and creation errors
- Database operation failures

All errors are logged with appropriate detail levels and user-friendly messages are returned to API consumers.

## Performance Considerations

- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays respect Träwelling API limits
- **Pagination**: Handles large datasets efficiently
- **Batch Processing**: Backlog processing works in configurable chunks
- **Caching**: OAuth2 states cached in memory (production should use Redis)
- **Database Efficiency**: Optimized queries for route matching and data retrieval

This integration provides a solid foundation for seamless data exchange between OVDB and Träwelling, making it easy for users to maintain their journey history across both platforms while enhancing existing OVDB data with rich timing and metadata information.
